                <br>
                Is the scent of apple boughs smoking<br/>
                in the woodstove what I will remember<br/>
                of the Red Delicious I brought down, ashamed<br/><br/>
                
                that I could not convince its limbs to render fruit?<br/>
                Too much neglect will do that, skew the sap's<br/>
                passage, blacken leaves, dry the bark and heart.<br/><br/>
                
                I should have lopped the dead limbs early<br/>
                and watched each branch with a goshawk's eye,<br/>
                patching with medicinal pitch, offering water,<br/><br/>
                
                compost and mulch, but I was too enchanted<br/>
                by pear saplings, flowers and the pasture,<br/>
                too callow to believe that death's inevitable<br/><br/>
                
                for any living being unloved, untended.<br/>
                What remains is this armload of applewood<br/>
                now feeding the stove's smolder. Splendor<br/><br/>
                
                ripens a final time in the firebox, a scarlet<br/>
                harvest headed, by dawn, to embers.<br/>
                Two decades of shade and blossoms—tarts<br/><br/>
                
                and cider, bees dazzled by the pollen,<br/>
                spare elegance in ice—but what goes is gone.<br/>
                Smoke is all, through this lesson in winter<br/><br/>
                
                regret, I've been given to remember.<br/>
                Smoke, and Red Delicious apples redder<br/>
                than a passing cardinal's crest or cinders. <br/><br/>
                —R. T. Smith
