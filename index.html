                Autoplay <br>
                I wandered lonely as a cloud <br />
                That floats on high o'er vales and hills, <br />
                When all at once I saw a crowd, <br />
                A host, of golden daffodils; <br />
                Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br />
                Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. <br /><br/>

                Continuous as the stars that shine <br />
                And twinkle on the milky way, <br />
                They stretched in never-ending line <br />
                Along the margin of a bay: <br />
                Ten thousand saw I at a glance, <br />
                Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. <br /><br/>

                The waves beside them danced; but they <br />
                Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: <br />
                A poet could not but be gay, <br />
                In such a jocund company: <br />
                I gazed—and gazed—but little thought <br />
                What wealth the show to me had brought: <br /><br/>

                For oft, when on my couch I lie <br />
                In vacant or in pensive mood, <br />
                They flash upon that inward eye <br />
                Which is the bliss of solitude; <br />
                And then my heart with pleasure fills, <br />
                And dances with the daffodils. <br />
