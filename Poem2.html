                <br>
                Autoplay <br>
                Thanks for the tree <br />
                between me & a snipers bullet. <br />
                I dont know what made the grass <br />
                sway seconds before the Viet Cong <br /> <br />

                raised his soundless rifle. <br />
                Some voice always followed, <br />
                telling me which foot <br />
                to put down first. <br /> <br />

                Thanks for deflecting the ricochet <br />
                against that anarchy of dusk. <br />
                I was back in San Francisco <br />
                wrapped up in a womans wild colors, <br /> <br />

                causing some dark birds love call <br />
                to be shattered by daylight <br />
                when my hands reached up <br />
                & pulled a branch away <br /> <br />

                from my face. Thanks <br />
                for the vague white flower <br />
                that pointed to the gleaming metal <br />
                reflecting how it is to be broken <br /> <br />

                like mist over the grass, <br />
                as we played some deadly <br />
                game for blind gods. <br />
                What made me spot the monarch <br /> <br />

                writhing on a single thread <br />
                tied to a farmers gate, <br />
                holding the day together <br />
                like an unfingered guitar string, <br /> <br />

                is beyond me. Maybe the hills <br />
                grew weary & leaned a little in the heat. <br />
                Again, thanks for the dud <br />
                hand grenade tosed at my feet <br /> <br />

                outside Chu Lai. Im still <br />
                falling through its silence. <br />
                I dont know why the intrepid <br />
                sun touched the bayonet, <br /> <br />

                but I know that something <br />
                stood among those lost trees <br />
                 & moved only when I moved. <br />
