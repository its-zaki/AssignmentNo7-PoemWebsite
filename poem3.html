                <br>
                I like the generosity of numbers. <br/>
                The way, for example, <br/>
                they are willing to count <br/>
                anything or anyone: <br/>
                two pickles, one door to the room, <br/>
                eight dancers dressed as swans. <br/> <br/>

                I like the domesticity of addition— <br/>
                add two cups of milk and stir— <br/>
                the sense of plenty: six plums <br/>
                on the ground, three more <br/>
                falling from the tree. <br/> <br/>

                And multiplication's school <br/>
                of fish times fish, <br/>
                whose silver bodies breed <br/>
                beneath the shadow
                of a boat. <br/> <br/>

                Even subtraction is never loss, <br/>
                just addition somewhere else: <br/>
                five sparrows take away two, <br/>
                the two in someone else's <br/>
                garden now. <br/> <br/>

                There's an amplitude to long division, <br/>
                as it opens Chinese take-out <br/>
                box by paper box, <br/>
                inside every folded cookie <br/>
                a new fortune. <br/> <br/>

                And I never fail to be surprised <br/>
                by the gift of an odd remainder, <br/>
                footloose at the end: <br/>
                forty-seven divided by eleven equals four, <br/>
                with three remaining. <br/> <br/>

                Three boys beyond their mothers' call, <br/>
                two Italians off to the sea, <br/>
                one sock that isn't anywhere you look. <br/>
